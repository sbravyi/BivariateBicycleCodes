# Simulation software used to generate data reported on Figure 3 of [BCGMRY]

## The simulation software consists of two python scripts

* `decoder_setup.py` is the offline part of the decoder that constructs check matrices,
syndrome measurement circuits, and decoding matrices for a particular quantum code.
This computation can take a few minutes per code. All code data is saved to disk.
One has to call decoder_setup.py only once for each combination (code, error rate, number of syndrome cycles). 

* `decoder_run.py` is the online part of the decoder that simulates error correction circuits. It relies on the software implementation of the Belief Propagation with the Ordered Statistics Decoder due to

### File naming
- the working directory that contains `decoder_setup.py` and `decoder_run.py` must 
contain folders "TMP" and "CODE_n_k_d" for each code [[n,k,d]] to be simulated. Initially these folders are empty.
- Folder "TMP" stores code data files with check matrices, syndrome measurement circuits, and decoding matrices.
- There is a separate data file for each combination (code, error rate, number of syndrome cycles). 
- Create code data files using `decoder_setup.py`
- Folder "CODE_n_k_d" contains a file `result` that stores the simulation results.

Each line in the `result` file has four columns:
- column 1: physical error rate,
- column 2: number of syndrome cycles,
- column 3: number of Monte Carlo trials,
- column 4: number of failed trials that resulted in a logical error.

Each trial runs the noisy error correction circuit followed by a noiseless syndrome measurement of all stabilizers, decoding, and error correction. A trial is failed if error correction results in a non-identity logical Pauli error.

Create `result` files using `decoder_run.py`

`distance_test.py` calculates the code distance by solving an integer linear program.
